The roadmap consists of 3 phases in chronological order to achieve progressive decentralization[^1], viz. Centralized Platform Launch, Decentralization of the Product and Decentralization of the Governance
### Phase 1: Centralized Platform Launch

The *founding team* will 

- raise capital from investors through equity financing by reserving governance tokens;
 
- recruit talent by direct compensation and indirect reserved governance token offering;

- build a centralized platform with the decentralization in mind focused on product / market fit and network effects;

  When building software applications, it is desirable to achieve the fine balance between the quality, speed and decentralization. In general speed > quality > decentralization, but building a decentralized application with decent quality and running it in a centralized manner in the beginning will benefit the company in the long run. This applies to the operation and management of the company as well.

- launch food pickup platform in select cities (e.g. Toronto) and beta test the platform;

- build a community of the restaurants, consumers and drivers;

- at the end of the phase, run a private fundraising from the participants of the platform who are given the option to purchase the governance tokens based on their revenue contribution to the platform.
  
### Phase 2: Decentralization of the Product 

The *founding team* will

- optionally run additional rounds of private fundraising when needed;

- build and launch the fully decentralized platform and put governance tokens in circulation;

- coordinate an Initial Public Token offering;

- invite members to participate in the governance of the organization;
  
- launch delivery service and test profit model such as a fixed commission fee;
  
- grow the community to a global audience;

- scale the platform to serve the global audience.
  
### Phase 3: Decentralization of the Governance

  The *founding team* will progressively hand over the power to the governing body of the organization leading to an eventual disbandment of the *founding team*. Thereafter, the first *election* will be run to elect the *president* of the organization who will then be bestowed the power on the *executive*.
